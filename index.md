## ✨ Why Context Bar?

VS Code has thousands of commands, but you probably only use a handful frequently. **Context Bar** turns the empty space in your editor title bar into a dynamic, context-aware dashboard for your most essential tasks.

No more memorizing complex key combinations. No more hunting through the Command Palette. Just **Pin, Click, and Code.**

### 🚀 Key Features

- **🎯 Context-Aware Buttons**: Buttons appear and disappear automatically based on the file extension you are currently editing (e.g., show a 'Run' button for `.py` files and a 'Preview' button for `.md`).
- **🎨 Swiss Minimalism**: A clean, distraction-free configuration interface that matches the native VS Code aesthetic. No "shiny" clutter—just pure functionality.
- **🔍 Smart Shortcut Search**: Don't know the Command ID? Just search by keybinding (like "Ctrl+S") or command name in our built-in builder.
- **📦 30+ Native Icons**: Support for the full library of official VS Code Codicons for a seamless, "built-in" look.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Zero UI lag. Context matches are pre-computed and cached for instantaneous tab switching.

## 🛠 Quick Start

1. **Open the Builder**: Type `Context Bar: Configure Shortcuts` in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. **Add a Shortcut**: Click "+ Add Action" and type a familiar shortcut or command name to see suggestions.
3. **Set the Scope**: Enter extensions like `md, py` or use `*` for a global button that never hides.
4. **Save & Apply**: Hit "Save & Apply" and watch your icons appear instantly in the tab bar.

## 📖 Pro Tips

- **Multi-Targeting**: List multiple extensions comma-separated (e.g., `ts, js, tsx`) to share a single button across languages.
- **Individual Toggles**: Use the checkboxes in the builder to quickly enable or disable buttons without deleting their configuration.
- **Edit JSON**: For power users, click the "Edit JSON" link in the header to modify your shortcuts directly in `settings.json`.
